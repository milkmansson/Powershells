# Powershells
Various Powershells that were useful at the time.  Most scripts have more relevant information commented out in the code.  Please use at your leisure!

### DeleteByIssuerThumbprint.ps1
Created to remove certificates by testing each for a specific issuer thumbprint.  Is suitable regardless of if issuer is a subCA or CA.  Adjust target store if necessary.  Script has a comment over the final instruction that does the deletion.  If you can find the comment and take it out, you are qualified to use this!


### DISCLAIMER!
I have no reason to think any of these won't work.  That said, if you use these, I cannot be responsible for misuse or accidental unpleasant outcomes.  I'd encourage you to read and understand the code before using it.
